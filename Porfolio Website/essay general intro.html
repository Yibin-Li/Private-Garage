		<font size = "5" color = "black">I include three essays in my portfolio: my coming of age essay, an analysis of the criteria of outstanding personal narrative, and a discussion about American exceptionalism based on Ready Player One. Each essay represents a stage in my writing, and the entire collection shows improvements of my writing capability. <br/>
		<br/>
		The first stage is writing in formal English. English is not my first language, so unlike native speaker, I am not able to exactly express my feeling and vividly present my story in English at first. This causes some problems in my coming of age essay. Although I am eager to show what I felt in my story, my peers and professor don’t feel the exact same emotions. After reading extensively about other writers’ work, I understand how to pick the strongest word that expresses the emotions, how to present a descriptive image to the readers, and how to use different sentence structure. <br/>
		<br/>
		The second stage is formulating my own thoughts. After reading man writers’ work, I have a basic criterion of an outstanding essay. Then I use a technique called “listing and expanding”: list all the arguments, pick some best-fit ideas, and expand these ideas. In this way, my essay becomes organized and clear, and my thesis is more debatable. <br/>
		<br/>
		The last stage is to find the best fit frame for my case frame essay. For me, to find an appropriate frame of my thesis is not easy. I need to search and read extensively of different essays to figure out which one is the best. This is like a dynamic writing process: I formulate a thesis first, and if I cannot find an appropriate frame, I will pick another thesis and search for the frame again. In Donald Murray's essay "Making Meaning Clearer, " she describes the same concept about his dynamic process “In other words, I have to have a focus before I can work on the focus. If, in each stage of the reading, the meaning does not become clearer and clearer, I go back and discover a potential meaning that can be brought into focus.” Under this idea, the essay is very clear to the readers. <br/>
