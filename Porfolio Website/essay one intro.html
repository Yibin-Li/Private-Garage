		<font size = "5" color = "white">The essay I choose here is about the coming-of-age of myself. English is not my first language, so this is my first essay about myself, the first chance tell myself to others in English. Sitting down and brainstorming the topic for a very long time, I was still unsure how to use different techniques to more vividly present this story. Then, after reading extensively about other writers memoir and personal narrative, I learned how to write a detailed and fascinated narrative that really drag the readers into my story.<br/>
		<br/>
		The first key is the detailed portray of myself. Since this is the personal memoir, my characteristics are very important. I added conversations into the essay to shape my identity, as well as the thoughts at the end. The contrast of characteristic before and after unfolds my coming-of-age.<br/>
		<br/>
		The second key is writing about my feelings and thoughts,  making the readers experience the entire story as I did before. For example in the essay here, I used lots of descriptive languages to describe how  I felt during the riding and what was my thoughts. By incorporating these essential elements into the essay, the readers can understand and appreciate my growth more.<br/>
		<br/>
		So here it is, my first essay about the growth of myself.
