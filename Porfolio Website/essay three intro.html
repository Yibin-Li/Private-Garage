		<font size = "5" color = "black">The essay here is a case frame essay of Ready Player One. Writing an essay about unfamiliar frames can be challenging. Since I never write a case frame essay before, the hardest part for me is to choose a frame that strongly links to the story itself. Usually, I need to formulate my thesis and arguments first, and then decide which frame I should choose. However, the relevant frame may not be easy to find. If I cannot find an appropriate frame for my thesis, I have to change my thesis and search for frame again until I am satisfied with the frame.<br/>
		<br/>
		My original thought about this case frame essay was writing an analysis about the impacts of virtual reality in our society (because Ready Player One is about a VR game in the future), but I was not satisfied with all frames of this topic I found, so I decided to change my topic. My second idea was the American’s culture and value in the Ready Player One. I searched in the library database and typed in some random words like “American value and culture” “future”. Suddenly a blue cover book popped up on the screen: The Modern Superhero in Film and Television: Popular Genre and American Culture. I read some reviews about the book and immediately decided to use this frame.<br/>
		<br/>
		From writing about a case frame essay, I learn that to choose a correct frame and thesis is more like a dynamic process: choosing a thesis first and then looking for relevant frames. If the frames are not fit enough, revise the thesis and look for frames again.
