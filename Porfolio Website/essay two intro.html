		<font size = "5" color = "black">The essay here is an analysis of outstanding personal narrative. One of the functions of an essay is communicating our thoughts and arguments to readers. Unlike the first essay emphasizing my feelings, the second essay focuses more on the logic of my opinions. Luckily, I learned to carefully organize my thoughts before I start to write them.<br/>
		<br/>
		To formulate a strong essay requires detailed and careful planning. The beginning of this process is brainstorming. I brainstorm every argument that related to my thesis, and then list them from most relevant to least relevant. Usually, I will have 4 to 7 arguments at this point, so I link each argument to the examples in the passage. If an argument appears first on my arguments list and has a relevant and powerful example, I will choose this argument in my essay and expand its idea. After repeating these steps, my draft becomes more logical.<br/>
